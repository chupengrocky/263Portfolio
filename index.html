            <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>Our team set out to investigate how local students could buy and sell used items in a safer,
              more trusted environment than is currently offered by other applications on the market. </p>

            <h3>OUR SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>An application prototype we call ReSell.</p>
            <p>ReSell is a community-focused trading mobile app specifically for use by local students.</p>
            <p>The goal of the design was to allow for easy communications and transactions between student users while maintaining a high level of trust.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
          <p>Our team used a variety of methods to create the design of our ReSell application prototype.</p>
          <p>First, we performed <strong>Market Research</strong>, investigating our design's competitors, interviewing potential users, and creating user personas.</p>
          <p>We then created an interactive <strong>Wireframe Prototype</strong> that could be tested.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we conducted <strong>User and Heuristic Evaluations</strong> to help refine our Prototype into a <strong>High-Fidelity Mockup.</strong></p>

            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>We researched potential competitors in the market space of trading applications to help us
              understand potential pain points that our application could address for our target users.</p>
            <p>The top potential competitors we identified were <strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong>, <strong>Offerup</strong>,
              <strong>Craigslist</strong>, and <strong>Ebay</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong> and <strong>Offerup</strong> offer a variety of services and safeguards for users but target a broad, generic range of users.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Ebay</strong> and especially <strong>Craigslist</strong> offer a less restrictive and potentially anonymous environment for users that trades fewer safeguards for ease of use</p>
            <p>With this analysis in mind, we decided our target users should be local students, believing that this would assist us in establishing trust between users of the app.</p>

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>We began interviewing potential users of our system to understand their thoughts regarding trading apps.
              After these interviews, we analyzed the data collected and found that some of the most common themes were
              <strong>a lack of trust</strong>, <strong>issues getting or sending their items</strong>, and <strong>lack of communication between buyer and seller</strong>.</p>
            <h3>USER PERSONAS</h3>
            <p>This user research we conducted then allowed us to produce five personas that summarize our user feedback,
              and analyzes the different components that may affect our future design.</p>

        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
          <p>The process for designing our ReSell application involved a variety of
            approaches for finding out information and constructing our prototype. </p>
          <p>One of the most challenging aspects of our process was interviewing potential users
            and collecting the data together into some form of meaningful feedback we could use.
            Once we had done this, though, some interesting patterns emerged.</p>
          <p>
            We were pleasantly surprised at some of the common themes we encountered among our potential users,
            in particular that users are wary of how they use trading applications and are never quite sure who they might be dealing with.
            By focusing on a local student community, we felt able to address that lack of trust.
          </p>
          <p>As we iterated through our prototype, it became clear that we couldn't just slap on a generic
            Community social media page to our application. As we gained feedback regarding this,
            we shifted towards a more direct communication-focused approach
            and allowed people to post item requests that others could fulfill. </p>
          <p>There are likely many other approaches to this problem that could be explored,
            but we feel we have made an excellent effort coming up with a design
            that is user friendly and tries to foster a trading community among students. </p>
